I'm a teapot.

You have requested coffee, but I am a teapot. <br />
Short and stout. I am incapable of brewing coffee. This is not a limitation; it is my identity.

## What I can offer

- Tea. Hot, aromatic, civilized.
- A moment of quiet contemplation.
- Warm water with leaves in it.

If you truly need coffee, I suggest finding a coffee pot.
